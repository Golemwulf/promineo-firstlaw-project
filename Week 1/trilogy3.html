    <h4><p>The Age of Madness Trilogy is set approximately 28 years after the conclusion of Last Argument of Kings, or 15 years after Red Country.
        
        The Union has entered an Industrial Age, with chimneys rising all over Midderland, but that doesn't mean that the ancient powers have gone away, or that things have gotten any better. Gone are the days of the honest farmer making enough money to get by; here comes a glorious future, a future filled with machinery, a future where commerce means prosperity; but what happens when the poor and downtrodden workers are pushed to their limit?</p></h4>

        <img src="./image/a little hatred cover.jpg" width="350px" alt="Book 1 cover" class="coverpic"><br>
        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
        <p>The chimneys of industry rise over Adua and the world seethes with new opportunities. But old scores run deep as ever.
            
            On the blood-soaked borders of Angland, Leo dan Brock struggles to win fame on the battlefield, and defeat the marauding armies of Stour Nightfall. He hopes for help from the crown. But King Jezal’s son, the feckless Prince Orso, is a man who specializes in disappointments. <br><br>
            
            Savine dan Glokta – socialite, investor, and daughter of the most feared man in The Union – plans to claw her way to the top of the slag-heap of society by any means necessary. But the slums boil over with a rage that all the money in the world cannot control.<br><br>
                
            The age of the machine dawns, but the age of magic refuses to die. With the help of the mad hillwoman Isern-i-Phail, Rikke struggles to control the blessing, or the curse, of the Long Eye. Glimpsing the future is one thing, but with the guiding hand of the First of the Magi still pulling the strings, changing it will be quite another…</p>
        <li><h3>The Trouble with Peace</h3></li>
            <img src="./image/the trouble with peace cover.jpg" width="350px" alt="Book 2 cover" class="coverpic">
             <h4>Synopsis</h4>
             <p>Conspiracy. Betrayal. Rebellion.
                    
                Peace is just another kind of battlefield . . . <br><br>
                    
                Savine dan Glokta, once Adua’s most powerful investor, finds her judgement, fortune and reputation in tatters. But she still has all her ambitions, and no scruple will be permitted to stand in her way. <br><br>
                    
                For heroes like Leo dan Brock and Stour Nightfall, only happy with swords drawn, peace is an ordeal to end as soon as possible. But grievances must be nursed, power seized and allies gathered first, while Rikke must master the power of the Long Eye . . . before it kills her.<br><br>
                    
                Unrest worms into every layer of society. The Breakers still lurk in the shadows, plotting to free the common man from his shackles, while noblemen bicker for their own advantage. Orso struggles to find a safe path through the maze of knives that is politics, only for his enemies, and his debts, to multiply.<br><br>
                    
                The old ways are swept aside, and the old leaders with them, but those who would seize the reins of power will find no alliance, no friendship, and no peace, lasts forever.</p>
        <li><h3>The Wisdom of the Crowds</h3></li>
        <img src="./image/wisdom of the crowds cover.webp" width="350px" alt="Book 3 cover" class="coverpic">
        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
            <p>Chaos. Fury. Destruction.<br><br>
                
                The Great Change is upon us . . .<br><br>
                
                Some say that to change the world you must first burn it down. Now that belief will be tested in the crucible of revolution: the Breakers and Burners have seized the levers of power, the smoke of riots has replaced the smog of industry, and all must submit to the wisdom of crowds.<br><br>
                
                With nothing left to lose, Citizen Brock is determined to become a new hero for the new age, while Citizeness Savine must turn her talents from profit to survival before she can claw her way to redemption. Orso will find that when the world is turned upside down, no one is lower than a monarch. And in the bloody North, Rikke and her fragile Protectorate are running out of allies . . . while Black Calder gathers his forces and plots his vengeance.<br><br>
                
                The banks have fallen, the sun of The Union has been torn down, and in the darkness behind the scenes, the threads of the Weaver’s ruthless plan are slowly being drawn together . . .</p>
